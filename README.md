    Note Taking App
    Derek Maxin
 
    ## Setup
    * Windows 10
    * IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.2 (Community Edition)
    * kotlin.jvm 1.7.10
    * Java SDK 17.0.4
 
    ## Enhancements
    1) Added a dark or light theme option. Click the new theme buttons in the toolbar to see the effect.
        Minimum width of the application was increased slightly so all buttons on the toolbar are always visible.
    2) Added an addition sorting option in the 'Order by' dropdown in the toolbar. The option is to sort 
        note content alphabetically.
